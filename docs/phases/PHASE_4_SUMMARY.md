## Technical Details

### Storage Organization
- Bucket: `essay-images`
- Path structure: `{user_id}/{timestamp}-{random}.{ext}`
- Files are private (RLS policies apply)

### Database Schema
- Essays stored in `essays` table
- Currently uses single `image_url` field
- Status: 'uploaded' (initial state)
- Future: Can extend to support multiple images via `essay_images` table

### Security
- Route protected by middleware
- RLS policies enforce user ownership
- File validation on client and server
- Authenticated uploads only

## Known Limitations

1. **Single Image URL**: Current schema uses one `image_url` field. Multiple uploaded images use the first one. Future enhancement: implement `essay_images` table for multiple images per essay.

2. **No OCR Yet**: Uploaded essays are not automatically transcribed. This will be implemented in Phase 5.

3. **No Essay List**: Dashboard doesn't show uploaded essays yet. This will be implemented in Phase 5.

## Next Steps - Phase 5

Phase 5 will implement:
- Essay list view on dashboard
- Essay detail page
- OCR integration (Google Vision API)
- Transcription display
- Edit/delete essay functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Upload fails with "User not authenticated"
- Ensure you're logged in
- Check browser console for auth errors
- Try logging out and back in

### Upload fails with "Upload failed: ..."
- Check Supabase Storage bucket exists
- Verify RLS policies are correct
- Check browser console for detailed error

### Files not appearing in Storage
- Verify bucket name is `essay-images`
- Check RLS policies allow authenticated uploads
- Ensure user_id folder structure is correct

### Progress bar stuck
- Check network tab for failed requests
- Verify Supabase credentials in `.env.local`
- Check file size isn't too large
