## üéØ What Was Built

### 1. **Dashboard Page (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)**

-   **User Welcome:** Displays a personalized welcome message and user profile information.
-   **Quick Stats:** Features a statistics section with cards for:
    -   Total essays submitted.
    -   Average score across all evaluated essays.
    -   Date of the last submitted essay.
-   **Essay List:** Lists all essays submitted by the user in a responsive grid.
-   **Empty State:** Shows a user-friendly message and a call-to-action when no essays have been submitted.
-   **Data Fetching:** Efficiently fetches all essays and their associated evaluation scores in a single server-side request.
-   **Call to Action:** Includes a prominent button for users to navigate to the upload page.

### 2. **Essay Management Components**

#### EssayCard Component (`components/essays/EssayCard.tsx`)

-   **Visual Display:** Shows a thumbnail of the essay image, the title, and the submission date (formatted as "time ago").
-   **Status Badge:** Displays a colored badge indicating the essay's current status (`Enviada`, `Transcrita`, `Avaliada`).
-   **Score Badge:** For evaluated essays, it now displays the overall score (e.g., `880/1000`).
-   **Actions:**
    -   Links to the detailed essay view.
    -   Includes a "Delete" button to remove the essay.

#### EssayList & EssayListClient (`components/essays/EssayList.tsx`, `components/essays/EssayListClient.tsx`)

-   **Filtering:** Allows users to filter the essay list by status.
-   **Sorting:** Provides options to sort essays by date (default) or title.
-   **Deletion Logic:** The `EssayListClient` handles the client-side logic for deleting an essay, calling the backend API and refreshing the page on success.

### 3. **Backend Deletion API (`app/api/essays/[id]/route.ts`)**

-   **Secure Endpoint:** The `DELETE` endpoint is protected and requires user authentication.
-   **Authorization:** Verifies that the user attempting to delete an essay is the actual owner.
-   **Comprehensive Deletion:**
    1.  Deletes the essay image from Supabase Storage.
    2.  Deletes the essay record from the database.
    3.  Cascades to delete any associated evaluation records.
-   **Robust Error Handling:** Returns appropriate error codes if the essay is not found or if the deletion fails.

## üîß Technical Implementation

-   **Data Fetching:** The dashboard page uses a server-side Supabase query to join `essays` and `evaluations` tables, ensuring all necessary data is available on initial load.
-   **Client Components:** State management for filtering and sorting is handled locally in the `EssayList` component using `useState`.
-   **Type Safety:** TypeScript types were updated across the component chain (`EssayCard`, `EssayList`, `EssayListClient`) to include the optional `evaluation` object, ensuring type safety.
